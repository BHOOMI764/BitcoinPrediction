Bitcoin Price Prediction Model
A machine learning project that predicts Bitcoin prices using historical data with remarkable accuracy.
Overview
This project implements a time series prediction model for Bitcoin prices, achieving near-perfect accuracy on test data from 2018-2021. The model successfully predicted Bitcoin's dramatic price movements, including the crash of 2018 and the bull run to $60,000+ in 2021.
Features

High Accuracy: Predictions closely match actual Bitcoin prices
Trend Capture: Successfully identifies major market movements
Robust Performance: Handles volatile cryptocurrency data effectively
Visual Analysis: Clear plotting of training, test, and prediction data

Dataset

Training Period: 2014-2018 (Bitcoin's earlier, more stable years)
Test Period: 2018-2021 (Including major crash and recovery)
Data Source: Historical Bitcoin closing prices in USD
